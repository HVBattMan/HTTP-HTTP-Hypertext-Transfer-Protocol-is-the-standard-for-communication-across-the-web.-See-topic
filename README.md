Fuel Cells - Hydrogen Fuel Cell Description &amp; Advantages ... https://www.hydrogenics.com/.../fuel-cells DefinitionFunctionsAppearanceMechanismDetailsApplications A fuel cell is a device that converts chemical potential energy (energy stored in molecular bonds) into electrical energy. A PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) cell uses hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) as fuel. The products of the reaction in the cell are water, electricity, and heat. This is a big improvement over internal combustion engines, coal burning power plants, and nuclear power plants, all of which produce harmful by-products. See more on hydrogenics.com
Hydrogen + Oxygen = Electricity + Water Vapor

Cathode: O2 + 4H+ + 4e– → 2H2O
Anode: 2H2 → 4H+ + 4e–
Overall: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
